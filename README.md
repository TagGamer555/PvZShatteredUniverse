# Welcome

This is just *one* of my passion projects. This is Plants vs Zombies: Shattered Universe, a work in progress fangame, inspired by works of other fans like myself.

It is written entirely in Python and uses Pygame to run.

I am new to GitHub, please be nice!

To run this game, you'll need to install the following libraries:
- Pygame 2.x

Run via `RUN_GAME.pyw` if you're on windows, otherwise run `main.py` through terminal.
