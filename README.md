# About

This is just *one* of my passion projects. This is Plants vs Zombies: Shattered Universe (PvZSU), a work in progress fangame, inspired by works of other fans like myself. It is written entirely in Python.

PvZSU is a strategic, lane-based tower defense game about defending yourself from incoming hordes of opportunistic zombies. As you progress further, you will encounter both new plants and new zombies to help and hinder you, respectively.





# How to Run

To run this game, you'll need to install the following libraries:
- Pygame 2.x

Run via `RUN_GAME.pyw` if you're on windows, otherwise run `main.py` through terminal.
