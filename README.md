# About

This is just *one* of my passion projects. This is Plants vs Zombies: Shattered Universe (PvZSU), a *work in progress fangame*, inspired by works of other fans like myself. It is written *entirely in Python* and runs on a *custom engine*.

PvZSU is a *strategic, lane-based tower defense game* about *defending yourself* from incoming *hordes of opportunistic zombies*. As you progress further, you will encounter both *new plants* and *new zombies* to *help and hinder* you, respectively.
